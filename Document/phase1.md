# 📋 Phase 1 — Project Initialization

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 🎯 Phase 1 Goals

Phase 1 focused on setting up the project foundation and documentation structure.

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created `Document/` folder for project documentation
   - Established proper folder organization

2. **Documentation Creation**
   - Saved complete project specification in `Document/Specification.md`
   - Created comprehensive `README.md` with project overview
   - Documented architecture, requirements, and development phases

3. **Version Control**
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Created initial commit with all documentation
   - Added `Initial` tag for project milestone

4. **Tab Bar Structure Implementation**
   - Created MainTabView.swift
   - Renamed ChatView to CompletionsChatView
   - Created ResponsesChatView Placeholder
   - Updated ContentView
   - Cleaned Up Old Files

## 🧪 Build Verification
- ✅ Successfully built for iPhone 16 simulator
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All Swift files compile correctly
- ✅ Project structure maintained

## 📱 Current App State
- **Tab 1 (Completions)**: Fully functional chat interface using existing Completions API
- **Tab 2 (Responses)**: Placeholder view showing "Coming in Phase 3"
- **Navigation**: Clean tab-based navigation with proper icons

## 🔄 Next Steps
Ready to proceed with **Phase 2**: Extending the API layer to support the new Responses endpoint.
